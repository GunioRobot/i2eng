i2e (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fake version increase in order to remove binary files from the sources
    (po/es.mo and compressed manpages)

  * Include <string.h> in i2e (note: should change those strcpy to strncpy...)
  * Wrote an i2e-cli manpage
  * Fixed i2e.1x and i2e.es.1 so that it refers to i2e-cli instead of i2e.sh
  * Fixed typos in i2e.1x
  * Remove the i2e.1 manpage from the package.
  * Removed dh-make templates.
  * Debian/copyright fixes including removal of dh-make template and proper
    GPL text.

  * Updated spanish translation to adapt to the i2e.sh->i2e-cli change
  * Fixed 'aniway' translation as suggested by Cesar Martinez Izquierdo (Closes:# 229039)

i2e (0.5-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from David Reviejo which uses a different GTK
    function and avoids locking the application (or the GUI)
    Thanks! (Closes: #183131)
  * Moved i2e.sh to i2e-cli since this is the one providing a command
    line only application. In the future maybe a wrapper script could
    be included (that called i2e or i2e-cli based on DISPLAY definition 
    or arguments) (Closes: #189540)
  * Adjusted README/LEEME for new i2e.sh's name
  * Removed call to dh_undocumented from the rules file

i2e (0.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * i2e.sh is now #!/bin/bash, since I'm not sure how to change 'declare -i'
    to work for other shells.
  * added a 3 sec time wait in the call to the function that analyses the
    clipboard 'miraPortapapeles' (which is called by gtk_idle_add) 
    (Closes: #179284, #177782)
  * Added proper information in the README.Debian file (Closes: #179282)
  * Removed undocumented link.
  * Added clipboard awareness as one of the features of i2e in the
    description.
