README version 0.5 for i2e


Introduction:
-------------

 i2e is an English-Spanish dictionary developed by Alfredo Casademunt
<darkd@wanadoo.es> under the GPL license at 8/1/2000.
 The program's source code can be downloaded from the Internet at the
following URL: http://darkd.virtualave.net
 The author declines all responsability derived from the use of this program
and only grants hard drive usage :-).


Requirements:
-------------

gettext and GTK+ 1.2 or latter libraries


Compilation and instalation:
----------------------------

You only need to:

 make
 su root
 make install

 Watch out! If you change the location of the i2e.dict file (by
default, this gets placed in the /usr/share/i2e directory) the
DICCIONARIO variable should also be changed inside the i2e.h file.

Makefile's other targets are:

 make clean

to clean the compilation's leftovers and the back-up files created by
editors. And also:

 su root
 make uninstall

to uninstall the program

Acknowledgements:
-----------------

 i2e was inspired by the program eidic.tcl by José Luis Triviño
<trivino@alcor.lcc.uma.es> from which the words database is taken (and
modified).

 I thank Miquel Collado <miquelc@gestmusic.es>, for his comments on the
source code.

 I also thank Amaya Rodrigo Sastre <barbwired@bigfoot.com> for translating
the README file and man page into English, and for reviewing my translation
into English of the messages uttered by i2e and i2e-cli

I also get on my knees in groveling, abject obsequiousness and
kiss the feet of the Unix-and-English-Translation God Lloyd
Zusman <lloyd@zusman.net>, without whose brilliant English-usage
insights and very humble nature, this document would otherwise have
had to be consigned to the dustbin of history.

 I thank Miquel Sergio Ahumada Navea <san@inf.utfsm.cl>, for building an .rpm
package.

 I thank José M. Macías <macias@cica.es> and Ricardo Villalba
<rvmsoft@jazzfree.com> for their comments on making i2e more comfortable
to use.

Thanks to all of them!


Future:
-------

 So uncertain... :-)
There could be a text version with as many features as the one for X, or maybe
KDE and/or GNOME compliant?
We'll see...

0.2 Version:
------------

 <return> key at numeric keypad is now working properly.
Manual page has also been changed.

0.3 Version:
------------

 i2e-cli script has been added to look up the dictionary in text mode.
Minor changes to dictionary's structure and to the formatting of the
translation from Spanish into English.

0.4 Version:
------------

 i2e s now aware of the enviroment variable LANG.
 It now finds words in Spanish, even if accents are not properly written (or
not written at all).
 I have also changed the way "exact search" works so that it makes better use
of the dictionary.
 I have moved the dictionary to /usr/share/i2e and have extensively reviewed
it (for the last time, I hope :-).

0.4.1 Version:
--------------

 A mistake while learning has been corrected and the translation into
English reviewed.

0.5 Version:
------------

 i2e is now constatly aware of the clipboard, so that if a word is selected
with mouse from any other application, it gets translated by i2e.
 Entry widgets no longer have a length limit.
 Learning function has also been upgraded.
